## Description

## Requirements

This module requires **webtrees** version 2.1 or later.
This module has the same requirements as [webtrees system requirements](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees#system-requirements).

This module was tested with **webtrees** 2.2.4 and later versions.

### Telegram Bot:
- Create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token).
- Obtain your bot's token and chat ID.

### Cron Jobs:
To ensure that the notifications are sent regularly (e.g., daily), set up cron jobs on your server. The exact URLs are shown on the module settings page.

1) Daily events (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.)

Example schedule (runs at 09:00 every day). Copy the actual URL from the module settings page.

```
0 9 * * * wget -O - -q "<URL from module settings>"
```

2) Daily changes digest (recent edits in the tree; record, when, who)

Example schedule (runs at 09:00 every day). Copy the actual URL from the module settings page.

```
0 20 * * * wget -O - -q "<URL from module settings>"
```

Notes:
- The changes digest ignores custom start/end texts and uses a fixed localized header.
- Use separate schedules if you want events and changes at different times.
